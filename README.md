# Place Management Budget Estimator

Professional BID budget analysis tool with interactive mapping, industry-standard calculations, and board-ready PDF reports. Draw polygons to analyze business districts and generate comprehensive budget estimates based on Overture Maps data.

## Local dev
```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```

Create `.env` from `.env.example` for local env if you want to call CARTO directly (not required when using Netlify proxy).

## Netlify deploy (recommended)
1) Connect this repo in Netlify ‚Üí set Build: `npm run build` and Publish dir: `dist`
2) Set **Environment variables** in Netlify (Production context):

```
# Server-side (set only in Netlify UI; do not commit values)
CARTO_SQL_BASE=__SET_IN_NETLIFY_ENV__
CARTO_CONN=__SET_IN_NETLIFY_ENV__

# Public values (safe in client bundle)
VITE_SQL_PROXY=/.netlify/functions/sql
VITE_PLACES_TABLE=__PUBLIC_TABLE_NAME__
VITE_BUILDINGS_TABLE=__PUBLIC_TABLE_NAME__
VITE_SEGMENTS_TABLE=__PUBLIC_TABLE_NAME__
```

Netlify serves the app from `dist/` and proxies `POST /api/sql` to a serverless function that hits CARTO with your key.
